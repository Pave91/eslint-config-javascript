rules:
  # Require Object Literal Shorthand Syntax
  # EcmaScript 6 provides a concise form for defining object literal methods and properties. This
  # syntax can make defining complex object literals much cleaner.
  object-shorthand: 0

  # Suggest using Reflect methods where applicable
  prefer-reflect: 0

  # Disallow generator functions that do not have yield
  require-yield: 0

  # Disallow use of the void operator
  no-void: 0

  # Require Radix Parameter
  # This rule is aimed at preventing the unintended conversion of a string to a number of a
  # different base than intended.
  radix: 0

  # Require IIFEs to be Wrapped
  wrap-iife: 0

  # Limit Maximum Depth
  # This rule aims to reduce the complexity of your code by allowing you to configure the maximum
  # depth blocks can be nested in a function.
  max-depth: 0

  # Limit Maximum Number of Parameters
  # Functions that take numerous parameters can be difficult to read and write because it requires
  # the memorization of what each parameter is, its type, and the order they should appear in.
  max-params: 0

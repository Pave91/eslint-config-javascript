  # Disallow new require

  # Enforce Callback Error Handling
  # This rule expects that when you're using the callback pattern in node you'll handle the error.

  # Disallow string concatenation when using _dirname and _filename
  # This rule aims to prevent string concatenation of directory paths in Node.js to make sure
  # developers use a platform-independent way of creating paths (we feel you, Windows).

  # Disallow `process.exit()`
  # It's better to throw an error and allow the application to handle it appropriately. Unhandled
  # errors always exit the process, but contrary to `process.exit()` they also print a stack trace.
